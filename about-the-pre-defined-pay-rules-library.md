# About the pre-defined pay rules library

[Original Page](https://www.replicon.com/help/about-the-pre-defined-pay-rules-library/)

Replicon provides a library of pre-defined pay rules for each US state, Canadian province and territory, and several other countries. We created and maintain these rules based on the labor laws of each jurisdiction.

See [Setting up pay rules](/help/setting-up-pay-rules/) for information on setting up your system to use the pre-defined rules.

We work hard to ensure the pre-defined pay rules match the current labor laws of each jurisdiction. However, we cannot guarantee that using the rule for a given region will put you in compliance with all employee pay regulations for that region. Please confirm that the pay rule you use meets all applicable labor laws for your jurisdiction.
