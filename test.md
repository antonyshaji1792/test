Depending on your permissions, you may be able to edit or submit timesheets on behalf of your direct reports. You might need to do this to keep your reports’ timesheets moving through the approval process, so that clients can be invoiced, project costs reconciled, and payroll processed in a timely manner.

You may also be able to delete timesheets belonging to your direct reports, although we don’t typically recommend doing this as it can disrupt the timesheet’s audit trail.

## Editing a timesheet

To edit a report’s timesheet:

  1. Go to **Team** > **Timesheets**.
  2. View the timesheet you want to edit by clicking the name of the item’s owner. Use the [filters](https://backendnewsite.wpengine.com/help/searching-and-filtering-lists/) to help find the timesheet, if needed.

The timesheet opens.

You can likely edit any timesheet that hasn't been submitted, or has been submitted but has only you as an approver. You may also have permission to reopen, then edit timesheets have already been approved or are awaiting approval by someone besides you. To reopen a timesheet, select the check box located beside it, and then click **Reopen**.

You may be required to give a reason why you're reopening the timesheet, in a dialog that displays.

  1. Make the needed changes to the timesheet.
  2. If you want to submit the timesheet, click the **Submit for Approval** or **Submit** button.

If you are the timesheet’s only approver, the timesheet will be automatically approved once you submit it, as your approval is implied.

## Submitting a timesheet

To submit a report’s unsubmitted timesheet:

  1. Go to **Team** > **Timesheets**.

## FAQs

### How will the user know if I submitted, edited, or deleted their timesheet?

If you make changes to a timesheet, the user will receive an email notifying them that it was edited, assuming this notification is enabled for the user.

If you submit a timesheet on a user’s behalf, when they receive notice that it was approved, that email will indicate who the timesheet was submitted by.

No notice is sent if a timesheet is deleted.

### Can I edit an approved timesheet?

If a timesheet is already approved, you may be able to [reopen](https://backendnewsite.wpengine.com/help/reopening-timesheets-so-your-reports-can-make-changes/) it and make changes.

### Can I have the timesheet’s owner make changes to it instead of me?

If changes aren’t needed urgently, or you want the user to be directly accountable for their own edits, you can [reject](https://backendnewsite.wpengine.com/help/approving-or-rejecting-items/) timesheets instead of editing them yourself. In this case, the user can make the necessary changes and resubmit.

### Can I convert a user’s overtime to time off in lieu on their behalf?

If you can edit the user’s timesheet, you should be able to convert their overtime to time off.

### Can I edit timesheets after they've been invoiced?

Yes, providing the _Prevent Changes to Invoiced Timesheets_ [workflow condition](https://backendnewsite.wpengine.com/help/configurable-timesheet-template-options/) isn’t enabled in the timesheet’s template. Refer to [Correcting billing errors](https://backendnewsite.wpengine.com/help/correcting-billing-errors/) for more information.
