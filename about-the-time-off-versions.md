# About the time off versions

[Original Page](https://www.replicon.com/help/about-the-time-off-versions/)

Recently, Replicon introduced a redesigned version of our time off functionality. We call it 'new time off'. This new version of time off is available in both our [new and legacy products](/help/choosing-your-products/), and we are currently in the process of enabling it for customers.

Customers who have purchased TimeAttend or TimeOff are unaffected by these changes and can continue to use their existing version.

## What is the difference between the versions?
