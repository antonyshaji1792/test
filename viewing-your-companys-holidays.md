You can view all holiday calendars your company has set up in Replicon. This can help you plan your time, and understand when colleagues in other locations might be unavailable.

To view holiday calendars:

  1. Go to **My Replicon** > **Time Off**.
  2. Click the **Calendar** tab, if you're not already viewing your calendar.
  3. Click the **Company Holidays** link located in the top, right-hand corner of the calendar.
